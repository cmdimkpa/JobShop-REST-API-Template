# JobShop-REST-API-Template
A Production-ready REST API Framework 

## Blood, Sweat and Tears
I built this REST API framework with my BST...but its my gift to the world. My pain for your joy :)

## So what is this thing?
If you have a Python REST API project using Python 2.7 / Flask / Apache2 / LibApache2ModWsgi / Linux(Ubuntu), then this code is all you'll ever need for your __init__.py (wsgi) file. Its as production-ready as they come. You literally have to copy and paste. Ah, but note these requirements:

- In addition to Flask, you'll need some Flask extensions: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and Flask RESTful, of course.
- I've added support for JSON Web Tokens, but this may be optional for you.
